/*
	For refactoring process. I made several choices to improve readability of code. I introduced constants for the hash algorithm, trivial partition key, maximum length and hash encoding to enhance maintainability and flexibility. Descriptive variable names and comments were added to explain purpose of each step. Code structure was simplified, utilizing optional chaining, constants and modern JavaScript features. By making these choices refactored version is easier to understand with clear separation of concerns and improved code organization. Updated code and accompanying comments provide a clear narrative of the logic, making it more readable and maintainable than the original version.
